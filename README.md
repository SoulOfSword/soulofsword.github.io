# Astro Profile Site — Inspired Starter

This is a GitHub Pages starter with a layout and section structure **inspired by** typical astrophysicist personal sites (single-page home with anchors + separate publications/software pages). It avoids copying any source and uses original styles.

## How to deploy
1. Rename the folder to `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` and update `_config.yml`.
2. Replace `assets/img/profile.jpg` and `assets/files/cv.pdf`.
3. Commit & push to GitHub, then enable Pages from the repository settings.

## Edit
- `index.html` — Home with sections: Welcome, Research interests, My research, Highlights, About.
- `publications.html` — Selected papers (link to ADS for full list).
- `software.html` — Project cards.
