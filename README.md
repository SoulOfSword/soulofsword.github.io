# Personal Website â€” Andrea Costa

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website:
ðŸ‘‰ [soulofsword.github.io](https://soulofsword.github.io/)

The site is hosted via **GitHub Pages** and built with plain HTML/CSS (no framework).
It serves as my professional homepage and includes information about my research and publications.
